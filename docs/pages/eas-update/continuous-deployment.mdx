## Concepts

### Fingerprint Runtime Versioning

The [`fingerprint` runtime version policy](/eas-update/runtime-versions/#fingerprint-runtime-version-policy) uses the `@expo/fingerprint` package to generate a hash of your project during build or update operations, and then uses that hash as the runtime version. The hash is calculated based on things like dependencies, custom native code, native projects, and configuration among others.

By automatically calculating the runtime version, one no longer needs to be concerned about about native layer compatibility with the JavaScript application when deploying updates to builds.

## Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Deployment (CD)

CI/CD for a React Native project dictates that every JS change (update) is deployed to all compatible builds over-the-air, and new builds are created when the runtime changes.

It can be accomplished by performing roughly these steps:
1. Run application tests, abort if tests fail.
2. Calculate fingerprint for relevant platforms using `npx expo-updates fingerprint:generate` command.
3. Check for EAS builds with a runtime version equal to the fingerprint (`eas build:list --runtimeVersion <fingerprint>`). Kick off a new build if none exists yet.
    - (optional) Submit to app stores for truly continuous deployment. This has not yet been tested and is not recommended.
4. Run `eas update` to publish an update for each commit.

### GitHub Actions

Expo provides a [GitHub Action](https://github.com/expo/expo-github-action/tree/main/continuous-deploy-fingerprint) for performing the steps above within a GitHub Actions workflow.

## Debugging fingerprint inconsistencies

If you notice different fingerprints being generated across different machines or environments, it may mean that there are unanticipated files being included in the hash calculation. `@expo/fingerprint` has a predetermines set of files to include/exclude for hash calculation, but often your project setup may require additional excludes. For projects that contain native code directories (`./android` and/or `./ios`) this is more common.

We provide tools for identifying which files are causing fingerprint inconsistencies and mechanisms to exclude those files from fingerprint calculations for your project.

To identify differences in fingerprint on different machines or environments:
- When running fingerprint generation commands on each machine/environment (`npx expo-updates fingerprint:generate`), pass `--debug` flag.
- Diff outputs from those command runs to determine files causing the difference. These tools may be helpful:
    - https://jsonformatter.org/json-pretty-print to format the output.
    - https://www.jsondiff.com/ to compare the output and identify the files causing the discrepancies.

To exclude files causing the differences, add them to `.fingerprintignore` as described in the [`@expo/fingerprint` README](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@expo/fingerprint).

### Debugging with GitHub Actions

Running the workflow in debug mode will automatically add the `--debug` flag to the commands run as part of the action, and the output should be available in the workflow run logs.
